- Reduced TBT (Total Blocking Time)

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Performance**
   - Run Lighthouse tests to verify improvements
   - Monitor Core Web Vitals in production

2. **Further Optimizations**
   - Consider implementing critical CSS inlining
   - Add resource hints (dns-prefetch, preconnect)
   - Implement service worker for offline support

3. **Image Optimization**
