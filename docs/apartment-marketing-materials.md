### 邮件模板 A：问题识别型

**Subject:** Quick question about your Chinese student tenants

**Body:**
```
Hi {{FirstName}},

With graduation season approaching, I'm curious - what happens to the 
security deposits and unpaid rent when Chinese students return home 
after graduation?

Most property managers tell me they just write these off as losses, 
assuming there's no way to collect once tenants leave the US.

But what if I told you these debts ARE recoverable?

Bingheng Credit specializes in collecting rent debts from Chinese 
nationals who've returned home. We handle everything compliantly 
through our Mainland China operations.

Interested in learning how much of last year's write-offs could 
have been recovered?

Best,

P.S. We work on success-based fees only. No recovery, no charge.

### 邮件模板 B：痛点聚焦型

**Subject:** Still writing off rent from international students?

**Body:**
```
Hi {{FirstName}},

If your property houses international students, you've probably 
noticed a pattern:

✓ Chinese students often leave after graduation
✓ They owe 1-3 months rent plus damages  
✓ Traditional collectors can't reach them
✓ You write it off as a loss

Last year alone, student housing companies wrote off over $100M 
in uncollectible international debt.

Binhheng Credit changes this equation. We:
- Locate debtors in Mainland China
- Negotiate in Mandarin
- Recover funds compliantly
- Remit directly to you

Would you like to see our success rates with similar properties?

**Subject:** How University Towers recovered $47K in "lost" rent

**Body:**
```
Hi {{FirstName}},

University Towers had written off $47,000 in rent from Chinese 
students who graduated in 2023. They assumed it was gone forever.

Then they tried Binhheng Credit.

Result: $28,200 recovered in 60 days (60% recovery rate).

The secret? We don't rely on US credit systems or legal threats. 
Instead, we use culturally appropriate negotiation tactics and 
have boots on the ground in China.

If you manage properties near {{University Name}}, you probably 
have similar uncollected debts sitting in your books.

Want to turn those write-offs into revenue?

Hi {{FirstName}},

Just following up on my previous email about recovering rent

I realize you're busy, so here's a quick stat: properties using 
our service recover an average of $50,000 per year that would 
otherwise be written off.

Worth a quick chat?
